This script (tries to) assign 10km grid cells as burnt or unburnt (using FESM layer) and then looks at species occurance 
within 10km said grid cells pre and post fire for both burnt and unburnt (control) sites. It should also equally subsample between the four groups 
(prefire_burnt, prefire_unburnt, postfire_burnt, postfire_unburnt) to control for spatial/temporal biases. It should calculate how many grid cells the 
10 most well-sampled species occur in for each group. I'm still not sure what's the best method to test whether differences are statistically significant.
